              "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

              "  xxmaj back in 1998 - 2000 there were dozen of films that dealt with global destruction of some sort . xxmaj the best one on my list so far is xxmaj deep xxmaj impact which was more believable than this one . xxmaj here are my problems with this film : 1 ) cheap special effects , like something out of the old computer . 2 ) no background information or explanation on weather patterns . xxmaj if you are going to make a movie about weather , at least have some decency to entertain the viewer with technical details . 3 ) xxmaj how come only 2 or 3 people figure out that the storm is converging on xxmaj chicago ... no more experts left in the field ? 4 ) where are some interesting characters ? i truly do n't care for anyone except maybe the pregnant woman . i felt that there was no character development . 5 ) no thought provoking moment what so ever and factually incorrect theme . xxmaj and this is only the first part of the film . i bet the conclusion will show us few destruction scenes and a search and rescue operation just like it has been done many times before . xxmaj and judging by the special effects in the first part of the movie , i can only imagine what we are to expect . xxmaj of course , at the end , the main characters will survive and life will go on ... how original\n",
