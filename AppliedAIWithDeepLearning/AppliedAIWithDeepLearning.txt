Important
----------

Gradient descent doesn't guarantee to converge in neural network beacause its a convex function always find global minimum in linear regression whereas neural network as lot of local minimum(Non convex) 
So if we chose Gradient descent in neural network go ahead with hyperparameter tuning



DeepLearning Fundamentals

Total points 7

1.Question 1

What is an example of a vector-vector multiplication?

2*3=6

(1,2,3) * (4,5,6) = (4,10,18)

(1,2,3) * (4,5,6) = 23

(1,2,3) * (4,5,6) = 32


2.Question 2

Which equation is correct give the following vectors?

Note: The "%*%" symbol is used to denote the "dot product"

w = (0.3,0.5,0.7)

x = (3,5,7)

w %*% x = 0.3 * 3 + 0.5 * 5 + 0.7 * 7

w %*% x = 0.3 + 3 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.7 + 7


3.Question 3

Please use this wikipedia article to answer the following question:

For which task an LSTM Neural Network is best suited?

Image Classification

Time-series analysis

Any type of sequence processing including Text and DNA


4.Question 4

To train an auto-encoder, what data is shown to the neural network on the right hand side?

X - The same data as on the left hand side

y - The actual labeled data


5.Question 5

Which dimension reduction technique is limited because it provides only a linear transformation of the data?

PCA - Principal Component Analysis

t-SNE - the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding

Deep Neural Network Auto Encoder


6.Question 6

Which optimization technique is the most commonly used for Neural Network training?

Gradient Descent

Montecarlo

Grid Search


7.Question 7
