Important
----------

Gradient descent doesn't guarantee to converge in neural network beacause its a convex function always find global minimum in linear regression whereas neural network as lot of local minimum(Non convex) 
So if we chose Gradient descent in neural network go ahead with hyperparameter tuning

1.Question 1

What is an example of a vector-vector multiplication?

2*3=6

(1,2,3) * (4,5,6) = (4,10,18)

(1,2,3) * (4,5,6) = 23

(1,2,3) * (4,5,6) = 32


2.Question 2

Which equation is correct give the following vectors?

Note: The "%*%" symbol is used to denote the "dot product"

w = (0.3,0.5,0.7)

x = (3,5,7)

w %*% x = 0.3 * 3 + 0.5 * 5 + 0.7 * 7

w %*% x = 0.3 + 3 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.7 + 7


3.Question 3

Please use this wikipedia article to answer the following question:

For which task an LSTM Neural Network is best suited?

Image Classification

Time-series analysis

Any type of sequence processing including Text and DNA


4.Question 4

To train an auto-encoder, what data is shown to the neural network on the right hand side?

X - The same data as on the left hand side

y - The actual labeled data


5.Question 5

Which dimension reduction technique is limited because it provides only a linear transformation of the data?

PCA - Principal Component Analysis

t-SNE - the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding

Deep Neural Network Auto Encoder


6.Question 6

Which optimization technique is the most commonly used for Neural Network training?

Gradient Descent

Montecarlo

Grid Search


7.Question 7

What are examples of a one-hot encoded vector?

Reference:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot

(0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0)

(1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0)






TensorFlow
Total points 6

1.Question 1

Which statement is correct?

TensorFlow is a high-level DeepLearning library allowing you to define only Neural Network layers

TensorFlow is a library for arbitrary numerical computation not limited to DeepLearning only
1 point

2.Question 2

What is a TensorFlow placeholder?

A TensorFlow program expressed as execution graph which can be run by the TensorFlow engine at a later stage

A way to add data to the TensorFlow execution graph at a later stage
1 point

3.Question 3

What data is usually stored in a TensorFlow variable?

The weight matrix W

Training data X

Label data y
1 point

4.Question 4

What statements are correct in respect to a unhealthy value distribution (histogram) of values in the weight matrix?

A uniform distribution indicates a lack of parameter updates and therefore problems with training

Values at the far end of the spectrum are indicating over-saturation of the weight matrix

Most of the values centered very close to zero forces gradients to become very small
1 point

5.Question 5

What is the relationship between accuracy and loss in a healthy and working neural network?

Both values should behave inverse during neural network training

accuracy and loss are basically the same measure, so they should behave identically
1 point

6.Question 6

Which statements about automatic differentiation in TensorFlow are correct?

Every operator in TensorFlow has registered the first derivative of it's operation as well. Therefore TensorFlow can apply the chain rule of automatic differentiation in order to compute the 1st derivative of any complex function

TensorFlow has a auto differentiation engine which is capable of can find out the 1st derivative of every atomic operation without being provided.

Keras
-------

What is the default backend of keras?

ans: Tensorflow
Theano
CNTK



Which layers should have an input_shape argument in an MLP?

Every single layer in our model
ans: Just the first layer
It depends on the layers



form keras.optimizer import SGD

sgd = SGD(lr= 0.01, decay= 1e-06, momentum= 0.9)
model.compile(loss=..., optimizer= sgd)


decay - decrease the learning rate factor after each parameter 



SystemML
---------


How to perform a matrix multiplication X and Y in DML ?

X.dot(Y)

X * Y

X %*% Y
Correct 

Correct answer. DML follows R-syntax for matrix multiplication.




Which of the following statements is true ?

SystemML provides an API called MLContext (in Scala, Java, and Python), that allows the user to register RDDs and DataFrames (previously created through Spark SQL or other libraries) as input and output variables of a DML script.
Correct 
is selected.This is correct.

Linear Regression DML script needs to be modified to run on Spark as it doesnot contain a reference to RDD.


The results of Linear Regression DML script may differ significantly over the same input data on different execution backend (such as Spark, Hadoop).


SystemML allows for algorithm reusability across data-parallel frameworks (such as Hadoop, Spark) and simplified deployment for varying data characteristics and runtime environments.
